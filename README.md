# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
   
   <p>This repository contains the code in R and documentation for "Getting and Cleaning Data Course" in Coursera. The purpose of this project was to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.</p>
    
   <p> Wearable Technology has been dependent on data science. Previously, Data Science was proprietary to companies processing data for internal use. Today open source data processing software and analysis tools have made it possible to apply the tools to various applications - social, mobile, and sensor-driven applications. This new competency in big data is changing the expectations for what is possible at the application level. Wearable Technology companies are focusing on reading various human activities via sensors and processing in real time . Efficient data analysis is essential for this purpose.</p>
   
   <p> The data set for this repository has been obtained from  <a href=https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip>
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set</a>.</p>

<p>30 volunteers within the age group of 14 to 45 years were selected for the study. Six activities including WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING were performed by each subject wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.  3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were captured by the gyroscope and the accelerometer at a constant rate of 50Hz.  The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.
